# minichat
My first try on Node.js. It's just an uncomplete and boring little chat 

This minichat is made with socket so it works in real time.  

How to start this app ? 

    - git clone the repository 
    - cd inside the repository 
    - run npm install to get dependencies
    - install and/or start mongodb on your computer 
    - change the connexion infos in dbconnect.js
    - run npm start 
    
It Works !
