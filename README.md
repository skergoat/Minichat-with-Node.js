# minichat
My first try on Node.js. It's just an uncomplete and boring little chat 

This minichat is made with socket, so it works in real time.  

How to start this app ? 

    - git clone the repository 
    - cd inside the repository 
    - install the depencies by running npm install 
    - change the database info in dbconnect.js 
    - then run npm start 
    
It Works !
